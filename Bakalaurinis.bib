	abstract = {In this work, we propose a deep learning approach to improve docking-based virtual screening. The deep neural network that is introduced, DeepVS, uses the output of a docking program and learns how to extract relevant features from basic data such as atom and residues types obtained from protein-ligand complexes. Our approach introduces the use of atom and amino acid embeddings and implements an effective way of creating distributed vector representations of protein-ligand complexes by modeling the compound as a set of atom contexts that is further processed by a convolutional layer. One of the main advantages of the proposed method is that it does not require feature engineering. We evaluate DeepVS on the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD), using the output of two docking programs: Autodock Vina1.1.2 and Dock 6.6. Using a strict evaluation with leave-one-out cross-validation, DeepVS outperforms the docking programs, with regard to both AUC ROC and enrichment factor. Moreover, using the output of Autodock Vina1.1.2, DeepVS achieves an AUC ROC of 0.81, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the best AUC reported so far for virtual screening using the 40 receptors from the DUD.},

network (CNN) models trained on 3D structural images of protein-ligand
complexes to distinguish binding from non-binding ligands for virtual screening.
However, the dearth of reliable protein-ligand x-ray structures and binding affinity
data has required the use of constructed datasets for the training and
evaluation of CNN molecular recognition models. Here, we outline various
sources of bias in one such widely-used dataset, the Directory of Useful
Decoys: Enhanced (DUD-E). We have constructed and performed tests to
investigate whether CNN models developed using DUD-E are properly learning the
underlying physics of molecular recognition, as intended, or are instead
learning biases inherent in the dataset itself. We find that superior
enrichment efficiency in CNN models can be attributed to the analogue and decoy
bias hidden in the DUD-E dataset rather than successful generalization of the
pattern of protein-ligand interactions. Comparing additional deep learning
models trained on PDBbind datasets, we found that their enrichment performances
using DUD-E are not superior to the performance of the docking program AutoDock
Vina. Together, these results suggest that biases that could be present in
constructed datasets should be thoroughly evaluated before applying them to
machine learning based methodology development.},

          , 
            
              As one of the most popular computational approaches in modern structure-based drug design, molecular docking can be used not only to identify the correct conformation of a ligand within the target binding pocket but also to estimate the strength of the interaction between a target and a ligand. Nowadays, as a variety of docking programs are available for the scientific community, a comprehensive understanding of the advantages and limitations of each docking program is fundamentally important to conduct more reasonable docking studies and docking-based virtual screening. In the present study, based on an extensive dataset of 2002 protein–ligand complexes from the PDBbind database (version 2014), the performance of ten docking programs, including five commercial programs (LigandFit, Glide, GOLD, MOE Dock, and Surflex-Dock) and five academic programs (AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, LeDock, rDock, and UCSF DOCK), was systematically evaluated by examining the accuracies of binding pose prediction (sampling power) and binding affinity estimation (scoring power). Our results showed that GOLD and LeDock had the best sampling power (GOLD: 59.8\% accuracy for the top scored poses; LeDock: 80.8\% accuracy for the best poses) and AutoDock Vina had the best scoring power (
              r
              p
              /
              r
              s
              of 0.564/0.580 and 0.569/0.584 for the top scored poses and best poses), suggesting that the commercial programs did not show the expected better performance than the academic ones. Overall, the ligand binding poses could be identified in most cases by the evaluated docking programs but the ranks of the binding affinities for the entire dataset could not be well predicted by most docking programs. However, for some types of protein families, relatively high linear correlations between docking scores and experimental binding affinities could be achieved. To our knowledge, this study has been the most extensive evaluation of popular molecular docking programs in the last five years. It is expected that our work can offer useful information for the successful application of these docking tools to different requirements and targets.},

	abstract = {Virtual Screening (VS) is designed to prospectively help identifying potential hits, i.e., compounds capable of interacting with a given target and potentially modulate its activity, out of large compound collections. Among the variety of methodologies, it is crucial to select the protocol that is the most adapted to the query/target system under study and that yields the most reliable output. To this aim, the performance of VS methods is commonly evaluated and compared by computing their ability to retrieve active compounds in benchmarking datasets. The benchmarking datasets contain a subset of known active compounds together with a subset of decoys, i.e., assumed non-active molecules. The composition of both the active and the decoy compounds subsets is critical to limit the biases in the evaluation of the VS methods. In this review, we focus on the selection of decoy compounds that has considerably changed over the years, from randomly selected compounds to highly customized or experimentally validated negative compounds. We first outline the evolution of decoys selection in benchmarking databases as well as current benchmarking databases that tend to minimize the introduction of biases, and secondly, we propose recommendations for the selection and the design of benchmarking datasets.},

CAs are zinc carrying enzymes that catalyse the reversible interconversion of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate and are involved in numerous cellular processes. They are therefore a common target for drugs. The suppression of CA activities through inhibitory compounds has found application for example in diuretics and in glaucoma therapy. In this book methods used to determine binding thermodynamics of inhibitory compounds (Isothermal titration calorimetry, Fluorescent thermal shift assay/differential scanning fluorimetry and others) will be compared in detail.

This classification scheme has been quoted for more than a decade and is still repeatedly quoted by some recent publications. Unfortunately, it does not reflect the recent progress in this field. Besides, the naming convention used for describing different types of scoring functions has been somewhat jumbled in literature, which could be confusing for newcomers to this field. Here, we express our viewpoint on an up-to-date classification scheme and appropriate naming convention for current scoring functions. We propose that they can be classified into physics-based methods, empirical scoring functions, knowledge-based potentials, and descriptor-based scoring functions.

Unfortunately, explicit structural information about hydrogen positions and thus H-bonds in protein-ligand complexes is extremely rare and similarly the important role of water during binding remains poorly understood. Here, we report on neutron structures of trypsin determined at very high resolutions ≤1.5 Å in uncomplexed and inhibited state complemented by X-ray and thermodynamic data and computer simulations. Our structures show the precise geometry of H-bonds between protein and the inhibitors N-amidinopiperidine and benzamidine along with the dynamics of the residual solvation pattern. Prior to binding, the ligand-free binding pocket is occupied by water molecules characterized by a paucity of H-bonds and high mobility resulting in an imperfect hydration of the critical residue Asp189. This phenomenon likely constitutes a key factor fueling ligand binding via water displacement and helps improving our current view on water influencing protein–ligand recognition., Trypsin is a serine protease. Here the authors present the high resolution X-ray and neutron diffraction structures of uncomplexed and inhibitor bound trypsin that provide insights into the geometry of H-bonds in the active site of the enzyme and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the kinetics of ligand binding induced desolvation.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding affinities of large sets of diverse molecules against a range of macromolecular targets is an extremely challenging task. The scoring functions that attempt such computational prediction are essential for exploiting and analyzing the outputs of docking, which is in turn an important tool in problems such as structure-based drug design. Classical scoring functions assume a predetermined theory-inspired functional form for the relationship between the variables that describe an experimentally determined or modeled structure of a protein-ligand complex and its binding affinity. The inherent problem of this approach is in the difficulty of explicitly modeling the various contributions of intermolecular interactions to binding affinity. New scoring functions based on machine-learning regression models, which are able to exploit effectively much larger amounts of experimental data and circumvent the need for a predetermined functional form, have already been shown to outperform a broad range of state-of-the-art scoring functions in a widely used benchmark. Here, we investigate the impact of the chemical description of the complex on the predictive power of the resulting scoring function using a systematic battery of numerical experiments. The latter resulted in the most accurate scoring function to date on the benchmark. Strikingly, we also found that a more precise chemical description of the protein-ligand complex does not generally lead to a more accurate prediction of binding affinity. We discuss four factors that may contribute to this result: modeling assumptions, codependence of representation and regression, data restricted to the bound state, and conformational heterogeneity in data.},

	abstract = {Docking tools to predict whether and how a small molecule binds to a target can be applied if a structural model of such target is available. The reliability of docking depends, however, on the accuracy of the adopted scoring function (SF). Despite intense research over the years, improving the accuracy of SFs for structure-based binding affinity prediction or virtual screening has proven to be a challenging task for any class of method. New SFs based on modern machine-learning regression models, which do not impose a predetermined functional form and thus are able to exploit effectively much larger amounts of experimental data, have recently been introduced. These machine-learning SFs have been shown to outperform a wide range of classical SFs at both binding affinity prediction and virtual screening. The emerging picture from these studies is that the classical approach of using linear regression with a small number of expert-selected structural features can be strongly improved by a machine-learning approach based on nonlinear regression allied with comprehensive data-driven feature selection. Furthermore, the performance of classical SFs does not grow with larger training datasets and hence this performance gap is expected to widen as more training data becomes available in the future. Other topics covered in this review include predicting the reliability of a SF on a particular target class, generating synthetic data to improve predictive performance and modeling guidelines for SF development.

	abstract = {Molecular recognition, which is the process of biological macromolecules interacting with each other or various small molecules with a high specificity and affinity to form a specific complex, constitutes the basis of all processes in living organisms. Proteins, an important class of biological macromolecules, realize their functions through binding to themselves or other molecules. A detailed understanding of the protein-ligand interactions is therefore central to understanding biology at the molecular level. Moreover, knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for the protein-ligand recognition and binding will also facilitate the discovery, design, and development of drugs. In the present review, first, the physicochemical mechanisms underlying protein-ligand binding, including the binding kinetics, thermodynamic concepts and relationships, and binding driving forces, are introduced and rationalized. Next, three currently existing protein-ligand binding models--the "lock-and-key", "induced fit", and "conformational selection"--are described and their underlying thermodynamic mechanisms are discussed. Finally, the methods available for investigating protein-ligand binding affinity, including experimental and theoretical/computational approaches, are introduced, and their advantages, disadvantages, and challenges are discussed.},

	abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks comprise a subclass of deep neural networks (DNN) with a constrained architecture that leverages the spatial and temporal structure of the domain they model. Convolutional networks achieve the best predictive performance in areas such as speech and image recognition by hierarchically composing simple local features into complex models. Although DNNs have been used in drug discovery for QSAR and ligand-based bioactivity predictions, none of these models have benefited from this powerful convolutional architecture. This paper introduces AtomNet, the first structure-based, deep convolutional neural network designed to predict the bioactivity of small molecules for drug discovery applications. We demonstrate how to apply the convolutional concepts of feature locality and hierarchical composition to the modeling of bioactivity and chemical interactions. In further contrast to existing DNN techniques, we show that AtomNet's application of local convolutional filters to structural target information successfully predicts new active molecules for targets with no previously known modulators. Finally, we show that AtomNet outperforms previous docking approaches on a diverse set of benchmarks by a large margin, achieving an AUC greater than 0.9 on 57.8\% of the targets in the DUDE benchmark.},

	abstract = {Scoring functions have been widely used to assess protein–ligand binding affinity in structure-based drug discovery. However, currently commonly used scoring functions face some challenges including poor correlation between calculated scores and experimental binding affinities, target-dependent performance, and low sensitivity to analogues. In this account, we propose a new empirical scoring function termed ID-Score. ID-Score was established based on a comprehensive set of descriptors related to protein–ligand interactions; these descriptors cover nine categories: van der Waals interaction, hydrogen-bonding interaction, electrostatic interaction, π-system interaction, metal–ligand bonding interaction, desolvation effect, entropic loss effect, shape matching, and surface property matching. A total of 2278 complexes were used as the training set, and a modified support vector regression (SVR) algorithm was used to fit the experimental binding affinities. Evaluation results showed that ID-Score outperformed other selected commonly used scoring functions on a benchmark test set and showed considerable performance on a large independent test set. ID-Score also showed a consistent higher performance across different biological targets. Besides, it could correctly differentiate structurally similar ligands, indicating higher sensitivity to analogues. Collectively, the better performance of ID-Score enables it as a useful tool in assessing protein–ligand binding affinity in structure-based drug discovery as well as in lead optimization.},

	abstract = {Classical scoring functions have reached a plateau in their performance in virtual screening and binding affinity prediction. Recently, machine-learning scoring functions trained on protein-ligand complexes have shown great promise in small tailored studies. They have also raised controversy, specifically concerning model overfitting and applicability to novel targets. Here we provide a new ready-to-use scoring function (RF-Score-VS) trained on 15 426 active and 893 897 inactive molecules docked to a set of 102 targets. We use the full DUD-E data sets along with three docking tools, five classical and three machine-learning scoring functions for model building and performance assessment. Our results show RF-Score-VS can substantially improve virtual screening performance: RF-Score-VS top 1\% provides 55.6\% hit rate, whereas that of Vina only 16.2\% (for smaller percent the difference is even more encouraging: RF-Score-VS top 0.1\% achieves 88.6\% hit rate for 27.5\% using Vina). In addition, RF-Score-VS provides much better prediction of measured binding affinity than Vina (Pearson correlation of 0.56 and −0.18, respectively). Lastly, we test RF-Score-VS on an independent test set from the DEKOIS benchmark and observed comparable results. We provide full data sets to facilitate further research in this area (http://github.com/oddt/rfscorevs) as well as ready-to-use RF-Score-VS (http://github.com/oddt/rfscorevs\_binary).},
